# Coffee-Leaf-Disease-Detection-App
🧠 How It Works
- Model Training: You've trained your detection model using large datasets—likely composed of thousands of annotated images of coffee leaves in different conditions.
- Prediction Categories:
- ✅ Non-disease – Healthy leaves.
- ☁️ Phoma – A fungal disease causing dark lesions and defoliation.
- 🟠 Rust – Coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), a common and harmful fungal infection appearing as orange spots.
- 🕳️ Miner – Leaf miners, which tunnel inside leaves and cause visible damage.
